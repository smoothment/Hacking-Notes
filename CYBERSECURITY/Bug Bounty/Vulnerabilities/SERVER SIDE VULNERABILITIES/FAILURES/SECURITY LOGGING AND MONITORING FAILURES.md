When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because, in the event of an incident, the attackers' activities can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions were performed by an attacker if they gain access to particular web applications. The more significant impacts of these include:

- **Regulatory damage:** if an attacker has gained access to personally identifiable user information and there is no record of this, final users are affected, and the application owners may be subject to fines or more severe actions depending on regulations.
- **Risk of further attacks:** an attacker's presence may be undetected without logging. This could allow an attacker to launch further attacks against web application owners by stealing credentials, attacking infrastructure and more.

The information stored in logs should include the following:

```ad-important
- HTTP status codes
- Time Stamps
- Usernames
- API endpoints/page locations
- IP addresses
```

These logs have some sensitive information, so it's important to ensure that they are stored securely and that multiple copies of these logs are stored at different locations.

As you may have noticed, logging is more important after a breach or incident has occurred. The ideal case is to have monitoring in place to detect any suspicious activity. The aim of detecting this suspicious activity is to either stop the attacker completely or reduce the impact they've made if their presence has been detected much later than anticipated. Common examples of suspicious activity include:

```ad-summary
- Multiple unauthorized attempts for a particular action (usually authentication attempts or access to unauthorized resources, e.g. admin pages)
- Requests from anomalous IP addresses or locations: while this can indicate that someone else is trying to access a particular user's account, it can also have a false positive rate.
- Use of automated tools: particular automated tooling can be easily identifiable, e.g. using the value of User-Agent headers or the speed of requests. This can indicate that an attacker is using automated tooling.
- Common payloads: in web applications, it's common for attackers to use known payloads. Detecting the use of these payloads can indicate the presence of someone conducting unauthorised/malicious testing on applications.
```

Just detecting suspicious activity isn't helpful. This suspicious activity needs to be rated according to the impact level. For example, certain actions will have a higher impact than others. These higher-impact actions need to be responded to sooner; thus, they should raise alarms to get the relevant parties' attention.
