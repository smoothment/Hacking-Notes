Many websites allow users to store results on a PDF file, but, some of them are programmed poorly, so, vulnerabilities can be exploited, let's see:


# WHERE DO THE RISK BEGIN

Risk begins if:

1. User input is not sanitized properly.
2. Backend not programmed properly.
3. Poor validation.


If the website does not follow a good security path, it may be vulnerable to:

- [HTML INJECTION](../INJECTIONS/HTML%20INJECTION.md)
- [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](../CROSS%20SITE%20SCRIPTING/CROSS%20SITE%20SCRIPTING%20(XSS).md)
- [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](../FILE%20INCLUSION%20VULNERABILITIES/LOCAL%20FILE%20INCLUSION%20(LFI).md)
