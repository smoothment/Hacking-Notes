In session hijacking attacks, the attacker takes advantage of insecure session identifiers, finds a way to obtain them, and uses them to authenticate to the server and impersonate the victim.

An attacker can obtain a victim's session identifier using several methods, with the most common being:

- Passive Traffic Sniffing
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Browser history or log-diving
- Read access to a database containing session information

As mentioned in the previous section, if a session identifier's security level is low, an attacker may also be able to brute force it or even predict it.

## Session Hijacking Example

Proceed to the end of this section and click on`Click here to spawn the target system!`. Use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM with the supplied VPN key to reach the target application and follow along. Don't forget to configure the specified vhost (`xss.htb.net`) to access the application.

A quick way to specify this (and any other) vhost in your attacking system is the below:

 Session Hijacking

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ IP=ENTER SPAWNED TARGET IP HERE
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ printf "%s\t%s\n\n" "$IP" "xss.htb.net csrf.htb.net oredirect.htb.net minilab.htb.net" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Part 1: Identify the session identifier**

Navigate to`http://xss.htb.net` and log in to the application using the credentials below:

```ad-important
- Email: heavycat106
- Password: rocknrol
```

This is an account that we created to look into the application!

You should now be logged in as "Julie Rogers."

Using Web Developer Tools (Shift+Ctrl+I in the case of Firefox), notice that the application is using a cookie named`auth-session` most probably as a session identifier. Double click this cookie's value and copy it! ![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/17.png)

**Part 2: Simulate an attacker**

Now, suppose that you are the attacker and you somehow got access to the`auth-session` cookie's value for the user "Julie Rogers".

Open a`New Private Window` and navigate to`http://xss.htb.net` again. Using Web Developer Tools (Shift+Ctrl+I in the case of Firefox), replace the current`auth-session` cookie's value with the one you copied in Part 1. Reload the current page, and you will notice that you are logged in as "Julie Rogers" without using any credentials!

Congratulations! You just practiced your first session hijacking attack!

Please note that you could come across web applications that utilize more than one cookie for session tracking purposes.

In the following sections, we will cover how you can mount the most common session attacks in detail.
