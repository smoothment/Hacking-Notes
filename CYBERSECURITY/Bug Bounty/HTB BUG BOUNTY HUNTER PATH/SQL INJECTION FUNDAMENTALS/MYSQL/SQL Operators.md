Sometimes, expressions with a single condition are not enough to satisfy the user's requirement. For that, SQL supports [Logical Operators](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/logical-operators.html) to use multiple conditions at once. The most common logical operators are`AND`,`OR`, and`NOT`.

---

## AND Operator

The`AND` operator takes in two conditions and returns`true` or`false` based on their evaluation:


```sql
condition1 AND condition2
```

The result of the`AND` operation is`true` if and only if both`condition1` and`condition2` evaluate to`true`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test';

+---------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test' |
+---------------------------+
| 1 |
+---------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc';

+--------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc' |
+--------------------------+
| 0 |
+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In MySQL terms, any`non-zero` value is considered`true`, and it usually returns the value`1` to signify`true`.`0` is considered`false`. As we can see in the example above, the first query returned`true` as both expressions were evaluated as`true`. However, the second query returned`false` as the second condition`'test' = 'abc'` is`false`.

---

## OR Operator

The`OR` operator takes in two expressions as well, and returns`true` when at least one of them evaluates to`true`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
| 1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 2 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 2 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
| 0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The queries above demonstrate how the`OR` operator works. The first query evaluated to`true` as the condition`1 = 1` is`true`. The second query has two`false` conditions, resulting in`false` output.

---

## NOT Operator

The`NOT` operator simply toggles a`boolean` value 'i.e.`true` is converted to`false` and vice versa':


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 1;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 1 |
+-----------+
| 0 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 2;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 2 |
+-----------+
| 1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As seen in the examples above, the first query resulted in`false` because it is the inverse of the evaluation of`1 = 1`, which is`true`, so its inverse is`false`. On the other hand, the second query returned`true`, as the inverse of`1 = 2` 'which is`false`' is`true`.

---

## Symbol Operators

The`AND`,`OR` and`NOT` operators can also be represented as`&&`,`||` and`!`, respectively. The below are the same previous examples, by using the symbol operators:

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 && 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 && 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
| 0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 || 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 || 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
| 1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 != 1;

+--------+
| 1 != 1 |
+--------+
| 0 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Operators in queries

Let us look at how these operators can be used in queries. The following query lists all records where the`username` is NOT`john`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| 1 | admin | p@ssw0rd | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
| 2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
| 4 | tom | tom123! | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The next query selects users who have their`id` greater than`1` AND`username` NOT equal to`john`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john' AND id > 1;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| 2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
| 4 | tom | tom123! | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Multiple Operator Precedence

SQL supports various other operations such as addition, division as well as bitwise operations. Thus, a query could have multiple expressions with multiple operations at once. The order of these operations is decided through operator precedence.

Here is a list of common operations and their precedence, as seen in the [MariaDB Documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/operator-precedence/):

- Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), and Modulus (`%`)
- Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`)
- Comparison (=, `>`,`<`,`<=`,`>=`,`!=`,`LIKE`)
- NOT (`!`)
- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)

Operations at the top are evaluated before the ones at the bottom of the list. Let us look at an example:


```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'tom' AND id > 3 - 2;
```

The query has four operations:`!=`,`AND`,`>`, and`-`. From the operator precedence, we know that subtraction comes first, so it will first evaluate`3 - 2` to`1`:


```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'tom' AND id > 1;
```

Next, we have two comparison operations,`>` and`!=`. Both of these are of the same precedence and will be evaluated together. So, it will return all records where username is not`tom`, and all records where the`id` is greater than 1, and then apply`AND` to return all records with both of these conditions:

```shell-session
mysql> select * from logins where username != 'tom' AND id > 3 - 2;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| 2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-03 12:03:53 |
| 3 | john | john123! | 2020-07-03 12:03:57 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

We will see a few other scenarios of operator precedence in the upcoming sections.

![Pasted image 20250131142339.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250131142339.png)

We can use limit first to check the structure of the table:

```
MariaDB [employees]> select * from titles limit 1;
+--------+-----------------+------------+------------+
| emp_no | title | from_date | to_date |
+--------+-----------------+------------+------------+
| 10001 | Senior Engineer | 1986-06-26 | 9999-01-01 |
+--------+-----------------+------------+------------+
```


Ok, since we need to filter for employee number greater than 10000 or title not containing engineer, we can use the following:

`select * from titles where emp_no > 10000 or title != 'engineer';`

If we use that, we can check the number of records at the end:

`654 rows in set`

Answer is `654`.
