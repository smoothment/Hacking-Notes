Now that we understand how to use the`mysql` utility and create databases and tables, let us look at some of the essential SQL statements and their uses.

---

## INSERT Statement

The [INSERT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html) statement is used to add new records to a given table. The statement following the below syntax:



```sql
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, column2_value, column3_value, ...);
```

The syntax above requires the user to fill in values for all the columns present in the table.

```shell-session
mysql> INSERT INTO logins VALUES(1, 'admin', 'p@ssw0rd', '2020-07-02');

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

The example above shows how to add a new login to the logins table, with appropriate values for each column. However, we can skip filling columns with default values, such as`id` and`date_of_joining`. This can be done by specifying the column names to insert values into a table selectively:



```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column2, column3, ...) VALUES (column2_value, column3_value, ...);
```

Note: skipping columns with the 'NOT NULL' constraint will result in an error, as it is a required value.

We can do the same to insert values into the`logins` table:



```shell-session
mysql> INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES('administrator', 'adm1n_p@ss');

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

We inserted a username-password pair in the example above while skipping the`id` and`date_of_joining` columns.

Note: The examples insert cleartext passwords into the table, for demonstration only. This is a bad practice, as passwords should always be hashed/encrypted before storage.

We can also insert multiple records at once by separating them with a comma:

```shell-session
mysql> INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES ('john', 'john123!'), ('tom', 'tom123!');

Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 2 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
```

The query above inserted two new records at once.

---

## SELECT Statement

Now that we have inserted data into tables let us see how to retrieve data with the [SELECT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statement. This statement can also be used for many other purposes, which we will come across later. The general syntax to view the entire table is as follows:


```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

The asterisk symbol (*) acts as a wildcard and selects all the columns. The`FROM` keyword is used to denote the table to select from. It is possible to view data present in specific columns as well:


```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

The query above will select data present in column1 and column2 only.


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| 1 | admin | p@ssw0rd | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
| 2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
| 3 | john | john123! | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
| 4 | tom | tom123! | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


mysql> SELECT username,password FROM logins;

+---------------+------------+
| username | password |
+---------------+------------+
| admin | p@ssw0rd |
| administrator | adm1n_p@ss |
| john | john123! |
| tom | tom123! |
+---------------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The first query in the example above looks at all records present in the logins table. We can see the four records which were entered before. The second query selects just the username and password columns while skipping the other two.

---

## DROP Statement

We can use [DROP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html) to remove tables and databases from the server.


```shell-session
mysql> DROP TABLE logins;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)


mysql> SHOW TABLES;

Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

As we can see, the table was removed entirely.

The 'DROP' statement will permanently and completely delete the table with no confirmation, so it should be used with caution.

---

## ALTER Statement

Finally, We can use [ALTER](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) to change the name of any table and any of its fields or to delete or add a new column to an existing table. The below example adds a new column`newColumn` to the`logins` table using`ADD`:


```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins ADD newColumn INT;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

To rename a column, we can use`RENAME COLUMN`:


```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO newerColumn;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

We can also change a column's datatype with`MODIFY`:


```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY newerColumn DATE;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Finally, we can drop a column using`DROP`:



```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins DROP newerColumn;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

We can use any of the above statements with any existing table, as long as we have enough privileges to do so.

---

## UPDATE Statement

While`ALTER` is used to change a table's properties, the [UPDATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) statement can be used to update specific records within a table, based on certain conditions. Its general syntax is:


```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1=newvalue1, column2=newvalue2, ... WHERE <condition>;
```

We specify the table name, each column and its new value, and the condition for updating records. Let us look at an example:


```shell-session
mysql> UPDATE logins SET password = 'change_password' WHERE id > 1;

Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 3 Changed: 3 Warnings: 0


mysql> SELECT * FROM logins;

+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining |
+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1 | admin | p@ssw0rd | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
| 2 | administrator | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
| 3 | john | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
| 4 | tom | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The query above updated all passwords in all records where the id was more significant than 1.

Note: we have to specify the 'WHERE' clause with UPDATE, in order to specify which records get updated. The 'WHERE' clause will be discussed next.

![Pasted image 20250131135106.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250131135106.png)

We can do the following steps:

```ad-summary
1. `show databases;`
2. `use employees;`
3. `show tables;`
4. `select * from departments`
5. Get the department number
```


If we follow the steps we see the following:

![Pasted image 20250131135655.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250131135655.png)

So, answer is `d005`.
