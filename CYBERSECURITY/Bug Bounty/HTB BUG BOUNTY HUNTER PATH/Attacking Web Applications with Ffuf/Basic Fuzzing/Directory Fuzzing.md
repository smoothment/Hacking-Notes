Now that we understand the concept of Web Fuzzing and know our wordlist, we should be ready to start using`ffuf` to find website directories.

---

## Ffuf


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -h

HTTP OPTIONS:
 -H Header `"Name: Value"`, separated by colon. Multiple -H flags are accepted.
 -X HTTP method to use (default: GET)
 -b Cookie data `"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2"` for copy as curl functionality.
 -d POST data
 -recursion Scan recursively. Only FUZZ keyword is supported, and URL (-u) has to end in it. (default: false)
 -recursion-depth Maximum recursion depth. (default: 0)
 -u Target URL
...SNIP...

MATCHER OPTIONS:
 -mc Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything. (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)
 -ms Match HTTP response size
...SNIP...

FILTER OPTIONS:
 -fc Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
 -fs Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and ranges
...SNIP...

INPUT OPTIONS:
...SNIP...
 -w Wordlist file path and (optional) keyword separated by colon. eg. '/path/to/wordlist:KEYWORD'

OUTPUT OPTIONS:
 -o Write output to file
...SNIP...

EXAMPLE USAGE:
 Fuzz file paths from wordlist.txt, match all responses but filter out those with content-size 42.
 Colored, verbose output.
 ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.org/FUZZ -mc all -fs 42 -c -v
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, the`help` output is quite large, so we only kept the options that may become relevant for us in this module.

## Directory Fuzzing

As we can see from the example above, the main two options are`-w` for wordlists and`-u` for the URL. We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword`FUZZ` to it by adding`:FUZZ` after it:

 Directory Fuzzing

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ
```

Next, as we want to be fuzzing for web directories, we can place the`FUZZ` keyword where the directory would be within our URL, with:


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w <SNIP> -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ
```

Now, let's start our target in the question below and run our final command on it:

 Directory Fuzzing

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ

We see that`ffuf` tested for almost 90k URLs in less than 10 seconds. This speed may vary depending on your internet speed and ping if you used`ffuf` on your machine, but it should still be extremely fast.

We can even make it go faster if we are in a hurry by increasing the number of threads to 200, for example, with`-t 200`, but this is not recommended, especially when used on a remote site, as it may disrupt it, and cause a`Denial of Service`, or bring down your internet connection in severe cases. We do get a couple of hits, and we can visit one of them to verify that it exists:

We get an empty page, indicating that the directory does not have a dedicated page, but also shows that we do have access to it, as we do not get an HTTP code`404 Not Found` or`403 Access Denied`. In the next section, we will look for pages under this directory to see whether it is really empty or has hidden files and pages.

![Pasted image 20250129141123.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250129141123.png)

If we fuzz we find the following directory:

![Pasted image 20250129141134.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250129141134.png)

Answer is `forum`
