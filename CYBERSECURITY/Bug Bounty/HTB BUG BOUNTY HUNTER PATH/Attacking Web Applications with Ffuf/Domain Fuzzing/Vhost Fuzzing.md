As we saw in the previous section, we were able to fuzz public sub-domains using public DNS records. However, when it came to fuzzing sub-domains that do not have a public DNS record or sub-domains under websites that are not public, we could not use the same method. In this section, we will learn how to do that with`Vhost Fuzzing`.

---

## Vhosts vs. Sub-domains

The key difference between VHosts and sub-domains is that a VHost is basically a 'sub-domain' served on the same server and has the same IP, such that a single IP could be serving two or more different websites.

`VHosts may or may not have public DNS records.`

In many cases, many websites would actually have sub-domains that are not public and will not publish them in public DNS records, and hence if we visit them in a browser, we would fail to connect, as the public DNS would not know their IP. Once again, if we use the`sub-domain fuzzing`, we would only be able to identify public sub-domains but will not identify any sub-domains that are not public.

This is where we utilize`VHosts Fuzzing` on an IP we already have. We will run a scan and test for scans on the same IP, and then we will be able to identify both public and non-public sub-domains and VHosts.

## Vhosts Fuzzing

To scan for VHosts, without manually adding the entire wordlist to our`/etc/hosts`, we will be fuzzing HTTP headers, specifically the`Host:` header. To do that, we can use the`-H` flag to specify a header and will use the`FUZZ` keyword within it, as follows:


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'

```

We see that all words in the wordlist are returning`200 OK`! This is expected, as we are simply changing the header while visiting`http://academy.htb:PORT/`. So, we know that we will always get`200 OK`. However, if the VHost does exist and we send a correct one in the header, we should get a different response size, as in that case, we would be getting the page from that VHosts, which is likely to show a different page.

![Pasted image 20250129154127.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250129154127.png)

After running an initial scan to the target, we can check that the size is `986`:

![Pasted image 20250129154503.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250129154503.png)

So, we need to filter in the following way:

`ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:49384/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -c -fs 986`


```
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:49384/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -c -fs 986
