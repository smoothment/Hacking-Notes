In this section, we will learn how to use`ffuf` to identify sub-domains (i.e.,`*.website.com`) for any website.

## Sub-domains

A sub-domain is any website underlying another domain. For example,`https://photos.google.com` is the`photos` sub-domain of`google.com`.

In this case, we are simply checking different websites to see if they exist by checking if they have a public DNS record that would redirect us to a working server IP. So, let's run a scan and see if we get any hits. Before we can start our scan, we need two things:

- A`wordlist`
- A`target`

Luckily for us, in the`SecLists` repo, there is a specific section for sub-domain wordlists, consisting of common words usually used for sub-domains. We can find it in`/opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/`. In our case, we would be using a shorter wordlist, which is`subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`. If we want to extend our scan, we can pick a larger list.

As for our target, we will use`inlanefreight.com` as our target and run our scan on it. Let us use`ffuf` and place the`FUZZ` keyword in the place of sub-domains, and see if we get any hits:


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.inlanefreight.com/

We see that we do get a few hits back. Now, we can try running the same thing on`academy.htb` and see if we get any hits back:


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://FUZZ.academy.htb/

We see that we do not get any hits back. Does this mean that there are no sub-domain under`academy.htb`? - No.

This means that there are no`public` sub-domains under`academy.htb`, as it does not have a public DNS record, as previously mentioned. Even though we did add`academy.htb` to our`/etc/hosts` file, we only added the main domain, so when`ffuf` is looking for other sub-domains, it will not find them in`/etc/hosts`, and will ask the public DNS, which obviously will not have them.

Let's run the following command:

`ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.inlanefreight.com/ 2>/dev/null -ic -c -t 200`

We'll get the following:
