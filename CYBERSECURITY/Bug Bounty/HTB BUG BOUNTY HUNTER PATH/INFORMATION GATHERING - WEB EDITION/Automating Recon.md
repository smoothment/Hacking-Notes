﻿While manual reconnaissance can be effective, it can also be time-consuming and prone to human error. Automating web reconnaissance tasks can significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy, allowing you to gather information at scale and identify potential vulnerabilities more rapidly.

## Why Automate Reconnaissance?

Automation offers several key advantages for web reconnaissance:

- `Efficiency`: Automated tools can perform repetitive tasks much faster than humans, freeing up valuable time for analysis and decision-making.
- `Scalability`: Automation allows you to scale your reconnaissance efforts across a large number of targets or domains, uncovering a broader scope of information.
- `Consistency`: Automated tools follow predefined rules and procedures, ensuring consistent and reproducible results and minimising the risk of human error.
- `Comprehensive Coverage`: Automation can be programmed to perform a wide range of reconnaissance tasks, including DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, web crawling, port scanning, and more, ensuring thorough coverage of potential attack vectors.
- `Integration`: Many automation frameworks allow for easy integration with other tools and platforms, creating a seamless workflow from reconnaissance to vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

## Reconnaissance Frameworks

These frameworks aim to provide a complete suite of tools for web reconnaissance:

- [FinalRecon](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon): A Python-based reconnaissance tool offering a range of modules for different tasks like SSL certificate checking, Whois information gathering, header analysis, and crawling. Its modular structure enables easy customisation for specific needs.
- [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng): A powerful framework written in Python that offers a modular structure with various modules for different reconnaissance tasks. It can perform DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, port scanning, web crawling, and even exploit known vulnerabilities.
- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester): Specifically designed for gathering email addresses, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers, and the SHODAN database. It is a command-line tool written in Python.
- [SpiderFoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot): An open-source intelligence automation tool that integrates with various data sources to collect information about a target, including IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and social media profiles. It can perform DNS lookups, web crawling, port scanning, and more.
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/): A collection of various tools and resources for open-source intelligence gathering. It covers a wide range of information sources, including social media, search engines, public records, and more.

### FinalRecon

`FinalRecon` offers a wealth of recon information:

- `Header Information`: Reveals server details, technologies used, and potential security misconfigurations.
- `Whois Lookup`: Uncovers domain registration details, including registrant information and contact details.
- `SSL Certificate Information`: Examines the SSL/TLS certificate for validity, issuer, and other relevant details.
- `Crawler`:
 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Extracts links, resources, and potential vulnerabilities from these files.
 - Internal/External Links: Maps out the website's structure and identifies connections to other domains.
 - Images, robots.txt, sitemap.xml: Gathers information about allowed/disallowed crawling paths and website structure.
 - Links in JavaScript, Wayback Machine: Uncovers hidden links and historical website data.
- `DNS Enumeration`: Queries over 40 DNS record types, including DMARC records for email security assessment.
- `Subdomain Enumeration`: Leverages multiple data sources (crt.sh, AnubisDB, ThreatMiner, CertSpotter, Facebook API, VirusTotal API, Shodan API, BeVigil API) to discover subdomains.
- `Directory Enumeration`: Supports custom wordlists and file extensions to uncover hidden directories and files.
- `Wayback Machine`: Retrieves URLs from the last five years to analyse website changes and potential vulnerabilities.

Installation is quick and easy:

 Automating Recon

```shell-session

 -o O Export Format [ Default : txt ]
 -cd CD Change export directory [ Default : ~/.local/share/finalrecon ]
 -k K Add API key [ Example : shodan@key ]
```

To get started, you will first clone the`FinalRecon` repository from GitHub using`git clone https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon.git`. This will create a new directory named "FinalRecon" containing all the necessary files.

Next, navigate into the newly created directory with`cd FinalRecon`. Once inside, you will install the required Python dependencies using`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This ensures that`FinalRecon` has all the libraries and modules it needs to function correctly.

To ensure that the main script is executable, you will need to change the file permissions using`chmod +x ./finalrecon.py`. This allows you to run the script directly from your terminal.

Finally, you can verify that`FinalRecon` is installed correctly and get an overview of its available options by running`./finalrecon.py --help`. This will display a help message with details on how to use the tool, including the various modules and their respective options:

|Option|Argument|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`-h`,`--help`||Show the help message and exit.|
|`--url`|URL|Specify the target URL.|
|`--headers`||Retrieve header information for the target URL.|
|`--sslinfo`||Get SSL certificate information for the target URL.|
|`--whois`||Perform a Whois lookup for the target domain.|
|`--crawl`||Crawl the target website.|
|`--dns`||Perform DNS enumeration on the target domain.|
|`--sub`||Enumerate subdomains for the target domain.|
|`--dir`||Search for directories on the target website.|
|`--wayback`||Retrieve Wayback URLs for the target.|
|`--ps`||Perform a fast port scan on the target.|
|`--full`||Perform a full reconnaissance scan on the target.|

For instance, if we want`FinalRecon` to gather header information and perform a Whois lookup for`inlanefreight.com`, we would use the corresponding flags (`--headers` and`--whois`), so the command would be:



```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ./finalrecon.py --headers --whois --url http://inlanefreight.com
