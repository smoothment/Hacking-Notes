Most websites nowadays utilize JavaScript to perform their functions. While`HTML` is used to determine the website's main fields and parameters, and`CSS` is used to determine its design,`JavaScript` is used to perform any functions necessary to run the website. This happens in the background, and we only see the pretty front-end of the website and interact with it.

Even though all of this source code is available at the client-side, it is rendered by our browsers, so we do not often pay attention to the HTML source code. However, if we wanted to understand a certain page's client-side functionalities, we usually start by taking a look at the page's source code. This section will show how we can uncover the source code that contains all of this and understand its general usage.

## HTML

We will start by starting the exercise below, open Firefox in our PwnBox, and visit the URL shown in the question:

As we can see, the website says`Secret Serial Generator`, without having any input fields or showing any clear functionality. So, our next step is to peak at its source code. We can do that by pressing`[CTRL + U]`, which should open the source view of the website:

As we can see, we can view the`HTML` source code of the website.

## CSS

`CSS` code is either defined`internally` within the same`HTML` file between`<style>` elements, or defined`externally` in a separate`.css` file and referenced within the`HTML` code.

In this case, we see that the`CSS` is internally defined, as seen in the code snippet below:

Code: html

```html
 <style>
 *,
 html {
 margin: 0;
 padding: 0;
 border: 0;
 }
 ...SNIP...
 h1 {
 font-size: 144px;
 }
 p {
 font-size: 64px;
 }
 </style>
```

If a page`CSS` style is externally defined, the external`.css` file is referred to with the`<link>` tag within the HTML head, as follows:



```html
<head>
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

---

## JavaScript

The same concept applies to`JavaScript`. It can be internally written between`<script>` elements or written into a separate`.js` file and referenced within the`HTML` code.

We can see in our`HTML` source that the`.js` file is referenced externally:

```html
<script src="secret.js"></script>
```

We can check out the script by clicking on`secret.js`, which should take us directly into the script. When we visit it, we see that the code is very complicated and cannot be comprehended:


```javascript
eval(function (p, a, c, k, e, d) { e = function (c) { '...SNIP... |true|function'.split('|'), 0, {}))
```

The reason behind this is`code obfuscation`. What is it? How is it done? Where is it used?
