The first and most dominant component of the front end of web applications is [HTML (HyperText Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML). HTML is at the very core of any web page we see on the internet. It contains each page's basic elements, including titles, forms, images, and many other elements. The web browser, in turn, interprets these elements and displays them to the end-user.

The following is a very basic example of an HTML page:

#### Example

Code: html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Page Title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1>A Heading</h1>
 <p>A Paragraph</p>
 </body>
</html>
```

This would display the following: ![HTML Example](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/75/web_apps_html_2.jpg)

As we can see, HTML elements are displayed in a tree form, similar to`XML` and other languages:

#### HTML Structure

 HTML

```shell-session
document
 - html
 -- head
 --- title
 -- body
 --- h1
 --- p
```

Each element can contain other HTML elements, while the main`HTML` tag should contain all other elements within the page, which falls under`document`, distinguishing between`HTML` and documents written for other languages, such as`XML` documents.

The HTML elements of the above code can be viewed as follows:

```html
<html>

ƒƒƒƒ<head>

<title>Page Title</title>

ƒƒƒƒ</head>

ƒƒƒƒ<body>

<h1>A Heading</h1>

<p>A Paragraph</p>

ƒƒƒƒ</body>

</html>
```

 

Each HTML element is opened and closed with a tag that specifies the element's type 'e.g.`<p>` for paragraphs', where the content would be placed between these tags. Tags may also hold the element's id or class 'e.g.`<p id='para1'>` or`<p id='red-paragraphs'>`', which is needed for CSS to properly format the element. Both tags and the content comprise the entire element.

## URL Encoding

An important concept to learn in HTML is [URL Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), or percent-encoding. For a browser to properly display a page's contents, it has to know the charset in use. In URLs, for example, browsers can only use [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding, which only allows alphanumerical characters and certain special characters. Therefore, all other characters outside of the ASCII character-set have to be encoded within a URL. URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a`%` symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits.

For example, the single-quote character '`'`' is encoded to '`%27`', which can be understood by browsers as a single-quote. URLs cannot have spaces in them and will replace a space with either a`+` (plus sign) or`%20`. Some common character encodings are:

|Character|Encoding|
|---|---|
|space|%20|
|!|%21|
|"|%22|
|#|%23|
|$|%24|
|%|%25|
|&|%26|
|'|%27|
|(|%28|
|)|%29|

A full character encoding table can be seen [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP).

Many online tools can be used to perform URL encoding/decoding. Furthermore, the popular web proxy [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) has a decoder/encoder which can be used to convert between various types of encodings. Try encoding/decoding some characters and strings using this [online tool](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/).

#### Usage

The`<head>` element usually contains elements that are not directly printed on the page, like the page title, while all main page elements are located under`<body>`. Other important elements include the`<style>`, which holds the page's CSS code, and the`<script>`, which holds the JS code of the page, as we will see in the next section.

Each of these elements is called a [DOM (Document Object Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model). The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) defines`DOM` as:

`"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."`

The DOM standard is separated into 3 parts:

- `Core DOM` - the standard model for all document types
- `XML DOM` - the standard model for XML documents
- `HTML DOM` - the standard model for HTML documents

For example, from the above tree view, we can refer to DOMs as`document.head` or`document.h1`, and so on.

Understanding the HTML DOM structure can help us understand where each element we view on the page is located, which enables us to view the source code of a specific element on the page and look for potential issues. We can locate HTML elements by their id, their tag name, or by their class name.

This is also useful when we want to utilize front-end vulnerabilities (like`XSS`) to manipulate existing elements or create new elements to serve our needs.
