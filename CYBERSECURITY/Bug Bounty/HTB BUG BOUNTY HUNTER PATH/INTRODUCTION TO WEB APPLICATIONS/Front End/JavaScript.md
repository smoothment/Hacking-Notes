[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)Â is one of the most used languages in the world. It is mostly used for web development and mobile development.Â `JavaScript`Â is usually used on the front end of an application to be executed within a browser. Still, there are implementations of back end JavaScript used to develop entire web applications, likeÂ [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

WhileÂ `HTML`Â andÂ `CSS`Â are mainly in charge of how a web page looks,Â `JavaScript`Â is usually used to control any functionality that the front end web page requires. WithoutÂ `JavaScript`, a web page would be mostly static and would not have much functionality or interactive elements.

#### Example

Within the page source code,Â `JavaScript`Â code is loaded with theÂ `<script>`Â tag, as follows:

Code:Â html

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
..JavaScript code..
</script>
```

A web page can also load remoteÂ `JavaScript`Â code withÂ `src`Â and the script's link, as follows:

Code:Â html

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

An example of basic use ofÂ `JavaScript`Â within a web page is the following:

Code:Â javascript

```javascript
document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed Text!";
```

The above example changes the content of theÂ `button1`Â HTML element. From here on, there are many more advanced uses ofÂ `JavaScript`Â on a web page. The following shows an example of what the aboveÂ `JavaScript`Â code would do when linked to a button click:

Original Text

As with HTML, there are many sites available online to experiment withÂ `JavaScript`. One example isÂ [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)Â which can be used to testÂ `JavaScript`,Â `CSS`, andÂ `HTML`Â and save code snippets.Â `JavaScript`Â is an advanced language, and its syntax is not as simple asÂ `HTML`Â orÂ `CSS`.

## Usage

Most common web applications heavily rely onÂ `JavaScript`Â to drive all needed functionality on the web page, like updating the web page view in real-time, dynamically updating content in real-time, accepting and processing user input, and many other potential functionalities.

`JavaScript`Â is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with the back end components and send and retrieve data, through technologies likeÂ [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)).

In addition to automation,Â `JavaScript`Â is also often used alongsideÂ `CSS`, as previously mentioned, to drive advanced animations that would not be possible withÂ `CSS`Â alone. Whenever we visit an interactive and dynamic web page that uses many advanced and visually appealing animations, we are seeing the result of activeÂ `JavaScript`Â code running on our browser.

All modern web browsers are equipped withÂ `JavaScript`Â engines that can executeÂ `JavaScript`Â code on the client-side without relying on the back end webserver to update the page. This makes usingÂ `JavaScript`Â a very fast way to achieve a large number of processes quickly.

## Frameworks

As web applications become more advanced, it may be inefficient to use pureÂ `JavaScript`Â to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host ofÂ `JavaScript`Â frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

These platforms introduce libraries that make it very simple to re-create advanced functionalities, like user login and user registration, and they introduce new technologies based on existing ones, like the use of dynamically changingÂ `HTML`Â code, instead of using staticÂ `HTML`Â code.

These platforms either useÂ `JavaScript`Â as their programming language or use an implementation ofÂ `JavaScript`Â that compiles its code intoÂ `JavaScript`Â code.

Some of the most common front endÂ `JavaScript`Â frameworks are:

- [Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_intro.asp)
- [React](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_intro.asp)
- [Vue](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_vue.asp)
- [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)
